The Landslides_Italy.ipynb is the file where I create most of my features, so run this first. 
The 6thsubCNNLandslides.ipynb is the file where I created my Deep CNN-Model. (I used a GPU from google colab)

Elevation [m]
Topographic Wetness Index
Slope [rad]
Aspect
Curvature
Rain 90 percentile
Rain average

Land Cover (Categorial)
